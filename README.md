Charts via Genero Report Writer 

Example demonstrating how you can incorporate Charts/Graphs etc in your Genero applicaiton via Genero Report Writer.

This is one method of putting charts/graphs in your Genero applicaiton that does not require the use of a 3rd party graph/chart web component, nor does it require you using fglsvgcanvas to produce something from scratch.  The downside is that you are limited to what options are available within Genero Report Writer for charting.
